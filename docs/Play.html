			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Now is the winter of our discontent </p>
			<p class="verseline">Made glorious summer by this sun of York; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house </p>
			<p class="verseline">In the deep bosom of the ocean buried</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Our bruised arms hung up for monuments; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Our dreadful marches to delightful measures</p>
			<p class="verseline">Grim-visag’d war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds </p>
			<p class="verseline">To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, </p>
			<p class="verseline">He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber </p>
			<p class="verseline">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute</p>
			<p class="verseline">But I-that am not shap’d for sportive tricks, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass— </p>
			<p class="verseline">I-that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty </p>
			<p class="verseline">To strut before a wanton ambling nymph— </p>
			<p class="verseline">I-that am curtail’d of this fair proportion, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cheated of feature by dissembling nature, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time </p>
			<p class="verseline">Into this breathing world scarce half made up, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And that so lamely and unfashionable </p>
			<p class="verseline">That dogs bark at me as I halt by them— </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Have no delight to pass away the time, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Unless to spy my shadow in the sun </p>
			<p class="verseline">And descant on mine own deformity</p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover </p>
			<p class="verseline">To entertain these fair well-spoken days, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I am determined to prove a villain </p>
			<p class="verseline">And hate the idle pleasures of these days</p>
			<p class="verseline">Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous, </p>
			<p class="verseline">By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams, </p>
			<p class="verseline">To set my brother Clarence and the King </p>
			<p class="verseline">In deadly hate the one against the other; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And if King Edward be as true and just </p>
			<p class="verseline">As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, </p>
			<p class="verseline">This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up— </p>
			<p class="verseline">About a prophecy which says that G </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury </h2>
			<p class="verseline">Brother, good day. What means this armed guard </p>
			<p class="verseline">That waits upon your Grace? </p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">His Majesty, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed </p>
			<p class="verseline">This conduct to convey me to th’ Tower</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon what cause? </p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">Because my name is George</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours: </p>
			<p class="verseline">He should, for that, commit your godfathers</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, belike his Majesty hath some intent </p>
			<p class="verseline">That you should be new-christ’ned in the Tower</p>
			<p class="verseline">But what’s the matter, Clarence? May I know? </p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest </p>
			<p class="verseline">As yet I do not; but, as I can learn, </p>
			<p class="verseline">He hearkens after prophecies and dreams, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And from the cross-row plucks the letter G, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And says a wizard told him that by G </p>
			<p class="verseline">His issue disinherited should be; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, for my name of George begins with G, </p>
			<p class="verseline">It follows in his thought that I am he</p>
			<p class="verseline">These, as I learn, and such like toys as these </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath mov’d his Highness to commit me now</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, this it is when men are rul’d by women: </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower; </p>
			<p class="verseline">My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ‘tis she </p>
			<p class="verseline">That tempers him to this extremity</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was it not she and that good man of worship, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Antony Woodville, her brother there, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, </p>
			<p class="verseline">From whence this present day he is delivered? </p>
			<p class="verseline">We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe</p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">By heaven, I think there is no man is secure </p>
			<p class="verseline">But the Queen’s kindred, and night-walking heralds </p>
			<p class="verseline">That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore</p>
			<p class="verseline">Heard you not what an humble suppliant </p>
			<p class="verseline">Lord Hastings was, for her delivery? </p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Humbly complaining to her deity </p>
			<p class="verseline">Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll tell you what-I think it is our way, </p>
			<p class="verseline">If we will keep in favour with the King, </p>
			<p class="verseline">To be her men and wear her livery: </p>
			<p class="verseline">The jealous o’er-worn widow, and herself, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Since that our brother dubb’d them gentlewomen, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Are mighty gossips in our monarchy</p>
			<p class="character">Brakenbury </p>
			<p class="verseline">I beseech your Graces both to pardon me: </p>
			<p class="verseline">His Majesty hath straitly given in charge </p>
			<p class="verseline">That no man shall have private conference, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of what degree soever, with your brother</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Even so; an’t please your worship, Brakenbury, </p>
			<p class="verseline">You may partake of any thing we say: </p>
			<p class="verseline">We speak no treason, man; we say the King </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; </p>
			<p class="verseline">We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot, </p>
			<p class="verseline">A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks</p>
			<p class="verseline">How say you, sir? Can you deny all this? </p>
			<p class="character">Brakenbury </p>
			<p class="verseline">With this, my lord, myself have naught to do</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow, </p>
			<p class="verseline">He that doth naught with her, excepting one, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Were best to do it secretly alone</p>
			<p class="character">Brakenbury </p>
			<p class="verseline">What one, my lord? </p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me? </p>
			<p class="character">Brakenbury </p>
			<p class="verseline">I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal </p>
			<p class="verseline">Forbear your conference with the noble Duke</p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">We are the Queen’s abjects and must obey</p>
			<p class="verseline">Brother, farewell; I will unto the King; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And whatsoe’er you will employ me in— </p>
			<p class="verseline">Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister— </p>
			<p class="verseline">I will perform it to enfranchise you</p>
			<p class="verseline">Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood </p>
			<p class="verseline">Touches me deeper than you can imagine</p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">I know it pleaseth neither of us well</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, your imprisonment shall not be long; </p>
			<p class="verseline">I will deliver or else lie for you</p>
			<p class="verseline">Meantime, have patience</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text"> Enter Lord Hastings </h2>
			<p class="character">Hastings </p>
			<p class="verseline">Good time of day unto my gracious lord! </p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain! </p>
			<p class="verseline">Well are you welcome to the open air</p>
			<p class="verseline">How hath your lordship brook’d imprisonment? </p>
			<p class="character">Hastings </p>
			<p class="verseline">With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks </p>
			<p class="verseline">That were the cause of my imprisonment</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For they that were your enemies are his, </p>

			<p class="character">Hastings </p>
			<p class="verseline">More pity that the eagles should be mew’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">What news abroad? </p>
			<p class="character">Hastings </p>
			<p class="verseline">No news so bad abroad as this at home: </p>
			<p class="verseline">The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And his physicians fear him mightily</p>
			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, he hath kept an evil diet long </p>

			<p class="verseline">‘Tis very grievous to be thought upon</p>

			<p class="character">Gloucester </p>
			<p class="verseline">Go you before, and I will follow you</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exit Hastings </h2>
			<p class="verseline">He cannot live, I hope, and must not die </p>
			<p class="verseline">Till George be pack’d with posthorse up to heaven</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">With lies well steel’d with weighty arguments; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, if I fail not in my deep intent, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Clarence hath not another day to live; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And leave the world for me to bustle in! </p>
			<p class="verseline">For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter</p>
			<p class="verseline">What though I kill’d her husband and her father? </p>
			<p class="verseline">The readiest way to make the wench amends </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is to become her husband and her father; </p>
			<p class="verseline">The which will I-not all so much for love </p>
			<p class="verseline">As for another secret close intent </p>
			<p class="verseline">By marrying her which I must reach unto</p>
			<p class="verseline">But yet I run before my horse to market</p>

			<p class="character">Keeper </p>
			<p class="verseline">Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day? </p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">O, I have pass’d a miserable night, </p>
			<p class="verseline">So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That, as I am a Christian faithful man, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not spend another such a night </p>
			<p class="verseline">Though ‘twere to buy a world of happy days- </p>
			<p class="verseline">So full of dismal terror was the time! </p>
			<p class="character">Keeper </p>
			<p class="verseline">What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me</p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower </p>
			<p class="verseline">And was embark’d to cross to Burgundy; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And in my company my brother Gloucester, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who from my cabin tempted me to walk </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon the hatches. Thence we look’d toward England, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And cited up a thousand heavy times, </p>
			<p class="verseline">During the wars of York and Lancaster, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That had befall’n us. As we pac’d along </p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling </p>
			<p class="verseline">Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard </p>
			<p class="verseline">Into the tumbling billows of the main</p>
			<p class="verseline">Olord, methought what pain it was to drown, </p>
			<p class="verseline">What dreadful noise of waters in my ears, </p>
			<p class="verseline">What sights of ugly death within my eyes! </p>
			<p class="verseline">Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks, </p>
			<p class="verseline">A thousand men that fishes gnaw’d upon, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, </p>
			<p class="verseline">All scatt’red in the bottom of the sea; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes </p>
			<p class="verseline">Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As ‘twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That woo’d the slimy bottom of the deep </p>
			<p class="verseline">And mock’d the dead bones that lay scatt’red by</p>
			<p class="character">Keeper </p>
			<p class="verseline">Had you such leisure in the time of death </p>
			<p class="verseline">To gaze upon these secrets of the deep? </p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">Methought I had; and often did I strive </p>
			<p class="verseline">To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood </p>
			<p class="verseline">Stopp’d in my soul and would not let it forth </p>
			<p class="verseline">To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But smother’d it within my panting bulk, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who almost burst to belch it in the sea</p>
			<p class="character">Keeper </p>
			<p class="verseline">Awak’d you not in this sore agony? </p>
			<p class="character">Clarence </p>
			<p class="verseline">No, no, my dream was lengthen’d after life</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, then began the tempest to my soul! </p>
			<p class="verseline">I pass’d, methought, the melancholy flood </p>
			<p class="verseline">With that sour ferryman which poets write of, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto the kingdom of perpetual night</p>
			<p class="verseline">The first that there did greet my stranger soul </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who spake aloud ‘What scourge for perjury </p>
			<p class="verseline">Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?’ </p>
			<p class="verseline">And so he vanish’d. Then came wand’ring by </p>
			<p class="verseline">A shadow like an angel, with bright hair </p>
			<p class="verseline">Dabbled in blood, and he shriek’d out aloud </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur’d Clarence, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That stabb’d me in the field by Tewksbury</p>
			<p class="verseline">Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!’ </p>
			<p class="verseline">With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends </p>
			<p class="verseline">Environ’d me, and howled in mine ears </p>
			<p class="verseline">Such hideous cries that, with the very noise, </p>
			<p class="verseline">I trembling wak’d, and for a season after </p>
			<p class="verseline">Could not believe but that I was in hell, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Such terrible impression made my dream</p>

			<p class="prose">I’ll not meddle with it-it makes a man coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbour’s wife, but it detects him. ‘Tis a blushing shame-fac’d spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom; it fills a man full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold that-by chance I found.

			<p class="verseline">[Reads] </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold, </p>
			<p class="verseline">For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.’ </p>
			<p class="verseline">A thing devised by the enemy</p>
			<p class="verseline">Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Conscience is but a word that cowards use, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Devis’d at first to keep the strong in awe</p>
			<p class="verseline">Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law</p>
			<p class="verseline">March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell; </p>
			<p class="verseline">If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell</p>

			<p class="verseline">What shall I say more than I have inferr’d? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Remember whom you are to cope withal- </p>
			<p class="verseline">A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways, </p>
			<p class="verseline">A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Whom their o’er-cloyed country vomits forth </p>
			<p class="verseline">To desperate adventures and assur’d destruction</p>
			<p class="verseline">You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest; </p>
			<p class="verseline">You having lands, and bless’d with beauteous wives, </p>
			<p class="verseline">They would restrain the one, distain the other</p>
			<p class="verseline">And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Long kept in Britaine at our mother’s cost? </p>
			<p class="verseline">A milk-sop, one that never in his life </p>
			<p class="verseline">Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Lash hence these over-weening rags of France, </p>
			<p class="verseline">These famish’d beggars, weary of their lives; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit, </p>
			<p class="verseline">For want of means, poor rats, had hang’d themselves</p>
			<p class="verseline">If we be conquered, let men conquer us, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers </p>
			<p class="verseline">Have in their own land beaten, bobb’d, and thump’d, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, in record, left them the heirs of shame</p>
			<p class="verseline">Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ravish our daughters? </p>
			<p class="verseline">[Drum afar off] </p>
			<p class="verseline">Hark! I hear their drum</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen! </p>
			<p class="verseline">Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head! </p>
			<p class="verseline">Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Amaze the welkin with your broken staves! </p>
